# Prerequisites & Setup

## Prerequisites

- [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) managed multi account environment with [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) federated account access
- Dedicated AWS account for deploying TEAM Application
  > As per AWS best practice, it is not recommended to deploy resources in the organization management account. Designate a dedicated account for deploying the TEAM solution.
  {: .note}
- Create groups within AWS IAM Identity center for **TEAM admins** and **TEAM auditors**. These groups can be created locally (In Identity center) or synchronised from an external identity provider following your organisation's group membership review and attestation process   
-  Enable Amazon SES in the **TEAM deployment account**. For production use case, move SES account out of **sandbox mode**  - [Moving out of the Amazon SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html)
- Designate a verified email address in Amazon SES for originating approval and TEAM workflow notifications - [Verifying identities in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html)
  > For testing and if your SES account is in sandbox mode, make sure all requester, approver and notification email addresses are verified in SES otherwise TEAM notification would not function as expected.
