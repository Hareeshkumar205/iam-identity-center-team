# Policy configuration
{: .no_toc}

Before users can request temporary elevated access in TEAM, a user with the **admin** persona needs to set up the application. This includes defining eligibility and approval policies. A user takes on the **admin** persona if they are a member of the **TEAM admin** Identity Center group specified during TEAM deployment.
{: .important}

## Eligibility policy configuration

**Eligibility policies** determine who can request temporary elevated access with a given scope. You typically define eligibility policies to allow specific people in specific teams to request temporary elevated access that you anticipate they will need to perform operational tasks as part of their job function.

To manage eligibility policies, login to the TEAM application as an admin. In the left-hand menu go to *Administration* -> *Eligibility policies*.

[Configuring eligibility policy]({% link docs/guides/admin.md %}){: .btn .btn-outline }

Each eligibility policy has five main parts:

- **Entity type and name**: A named Identity Center user or group
- **AWS accounts or OUs**: One or more AWS accounts and/or [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/) organizational units (OUs).
- **Permissions**: One or more Identity Center [permission sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html) (representing [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)).
- **Maximum duration**: Determines the maximum elevated access duration in hours (between 1 - 8000 hours / ~ 1 year) that can be requested by an entity.
- **Approval required**: Determines if approval is required for elevated access requested by an entity
 
If a user belongs to multiple groups with different policies, an approval required policy will take precedence over an approval not required policy. This configuration is disregarded if approval required is turned off globally in the TEAM settings
{: .note}

Each eligibility policy allows the specified Identity Center user, or any member of the specified group, to log into TEAM and request temporary elevated access using the specified permission set(s) in the specified AWS account(s).

When choosing permission sets, you can either use a predefined permission set provided by Identity Center, or you can create your own permission sets using custom permissions in order to provide least-privilege access for particular operational tasks.

> Where an eligibility policy specifies an OU, TEAM includes all the AWS accounts directly in that OU. It does not include those in its child OUs.
{: .note}

## Approver policy configuration

**Approver policies** work in a similar way to eligibility policies, except they authorize users to approve temporary elevated access requests, rather than create them.

If a specific AWS account is referenced in an eligibility policy that is configured to require approval, then there must be a corresponding approval policy for the same account. If there is no corresponding approval group - or if there is an approval group, but it has no members - then TEAM wonâ€™t allow users to request temporary elevated access to that account, because no-one can approve it. The exception to this is in the case that the approval required setting is turned off global in the TEAM settings.

To manage approval policies, login to the TEAM application as an admin. Go to *Administration* -> *Approver policy*.

[Configuring approval policy]({% link docs/guides/admin.md %}){: .btn .btn-outline }

Each approval policy allows any member of the specified groups to log into TEAM and approve any temporary elevated access requests to the specified AWS account(s), **regardless of permission set**.

> If you use the same group for both eligibility and approval, then it means approvers can be in the same team as requesters. This can be a valid approach, and is sometimes known as *peer approval*. In any case, **TEAM does not allow an individual to approve their own request**. If you prefer requesters and approvers to be in different teams, specify different groups for eligibility and approval.

Now that the admin persona has defined eligibility and approval policies, TEAM is ready for use.
